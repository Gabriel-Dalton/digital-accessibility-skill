## Guidance for Filling Out the Template

### Conformance Status
Be honest. Courts and regulators view overclaiming conformance more negatively than transparently admitting partial conformance with a remediation plan. "Partially conformant" with a clear plan is better than "fully conformant" when it's not true.

### Known Limitations
List specific, concrete limitations. Vague statements like "some content may not be accessible" are unhelpful. Name the specific content types, pages, or features.

### Assessment Methods
If the user hasn't done formal testing, recommend they at minimum: run axe-core or Lighthouse, do a keyboard walkthrough, and test with one screen reader. Note the methods actually used — don't claim user testing if it didn't happen.

### Feedback Mechanism
This is legally required in many jurisdictions (ACA, EAA, AODA). The mechanism must be accessible itself. Provide multiple contact methods (not just a web form — someone who can't use the form needs an alternative).

### Review Schedule
Recommend reviewing and updating the statement at least annually, and after any major site redesign or new feature launch.
